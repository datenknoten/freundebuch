# Personal CRM - Relationship Management for Individuals

A self-hostable web application that helps individuals and families actively maintain their social connections through intelligent contact management, interaction tracking, and relationship reminders.

## What is it?

Personal CRM extends a traditional address book with features designed to help you nurture meaningful relationships:

- **Smart Contact Management** - Store not just contact details, but context: how you met, shared interests, important dates
- **Interaction Tracking** - Log meetings, calls, and messages to maintain relationship history
- **Intelligent Reminders** - Get notified when you haven't contacted someone in a while, upcoming birthdays, and custom follow-ups
- **Relationship Insights** - Visualize your social network and identify connections that need attention
- **Multi-User Support** - Share contact management within families or households
- **Standards-Based Sync** - CardDAV/CalDAV integration for seamless synchronization with phones and calendars

## Project Vision

Transform personal relationship management from reactive to proactive - helping people stay connected with the relationships that matter most.

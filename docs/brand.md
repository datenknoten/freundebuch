## The Name

**Freundebuch** (German: "Friendship Book")

The name comes from the German tradition of "Freundebuch" - a blank book that children in kindergarten pass around to their friends. Each friend fills out a page about themselves: their favorite color, what they want to be when they grow up, their hobbies, and so on. By the end of kindergarten, you have a book full of memories and details about your childhood friends.

But we're not in kindergarten anymore.

As adults, we don't pass around friendship books. Yet we still want to remember the important details about the people in our lives - their birthdays, their kids' names, where they work, how we met, when we last caught up. Freundebuch is the grown-up version of that childhood tradition: a digital friendship book where you keep track of the people who matter to you.

## Brand Story

Remember that feeling when you got your Freundebuch back from a friend? Flipping to their page and discovering their favorite animal was a dolphin, or that they wanted to be an astronaut? It was a little window into who they were.

Freundebuch captures that same spirit - but for the complexity of adult relationships. It's not about managing "contacts" like a salesperson. It's about maintaining meaningful connections with the people in your life. Friends, family, colleagues, neighbors, that interesting person you met at a conference.

We're not building a CRM. We're building a friendship book for adults.

## Core Values

### Relationships Over Data
Traditional contact apps store data points. Freundebuch stores relationships. Every feature we build asks: "Does this help someone maintain better connections with the people they care about?"

### Privacy First
Your relationships are intimate and personal. Your data stays yours. Self-hostable, standards-based, no lock-in.

### Warmth and Humanity
Technology should feel human. Our design, language, and interactions should feel like talking to a friend who remembers everything, not like using enterprise software.

### Simplicity Over Features
We'd rather do a few things beautifully than many things adequately. If a feature doesn't serve the core mission of helping you stay connected, we don't build it.

## Terminology Guide

The words we use shape how people think about the product. Here's our preferred terminology:

### Do Use

| Term | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Friend** | Even when referring to all people in the app, "friend" feels warmer than "contact" |
| **Page** | Each person has a "page" in your Freundebuch (like pages in the original books) |
| **Note** | Personal observations and memories you write down |
| **Catch up** | What you do with friends, not "interactions" or "touchpoints" |
| **Circle** | A group of friends (family circle, work circle, hiking circle) |
| **Remember** | What the app helps you do - "Freundebuch remembers so you don't forget" |
| **Stay in touch** | The goal - maintaining connections over time |
| **Reach out** | The action of contacting someone |
| **Your Freundebuch** | The entire collection of your friends and memories |

### Avoid

| Don't Use | Use Instead | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Contact | Friend, person, someone | Too transactional |
| CRM | Freundebuch, friendship book | We're not a business tool |
| Lead, prospect | (n/a) | Sales language has no place here |
| Interaction | Catch-up, conversation, meeting | Too clinical |
| Touchpoint | (n/a) | Corporate jargon |
| Pipeline | (n/a) | Sales concept |
| Engagement | Connection, relationship | Too marketing-speak |
| User | You | We talk to people, not users |
| Database | Freundebuch, your pages | Technical term |

### Contextual Terms

Some terms have specific meanings within Freundebuch:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Page** | A friend's profile - all the information about one person |
| **Circle** | A way to organize friends (replaces "group" or "category") |
| **Tag** | Free-form labels for quick filtering (#hiking, #bookclub) |
| **Timeline** | The history of your relationship with someone |
| **Reminder** | A nudge to reach out to someone |
| **Collective** | A group entity (family, company, club) that friends belong to |

## Voice and Tone

See [tone.md](./tone.md) for detailed writing guidelines. The short version:

- **Professional yet fun** - like a helpful friend who knows their stuff
- **Warm and approachable** - never corporate or cold
- **Clear and concise** - respect people's time
- **Human** - talk like a person, not a manual

### Example Phrases

Instead of:
> "No contacts found matching your search criteria."

Write:
> "Hmm, no one matches that search. Try different keywords?"

Instead of:
> "Contact created successfully."

Write:
> "Added to your Freundebuch!"

Instead of:
> "Configure your notification preferences."

Write:
> "How do you want us to remind you?"

## Feature Naming

When naming features, prefer human-readable names over technical ones:

| Technical Concept | Freundebuch Name |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Contact list | Your Freundebuch / Friends |
| Contact profile | [Name]'s page |
| Groups/categories | Circles |
| Encounter log | Timeline |
| Contact frequency alerts | Reminders |
| Data synchronization | Sync |

## International Considerations

While "Freundebuch" is German, the concept of friendship books exists in many cultures. The name is:
- Distinctive and memorable
- Easy to pronounce for English speakers (FROYN-deh-bookh)
- Carries the core concept in its meaning
- Works as a single word (no spaces, easy URLs)

The app interface will be in English first, with internationalization planned for the future.

## Applying the Brand

When creating any content for Freundebuch - whether documentation, UI copy, marketing material, or code comments - ask yourself:

1. Does this sound like we're talking about friends, not contacts?
2. Is the language warm and human?
3. Would this feel at home in a friendship book?
4. Does it avoid corporate/sales jargon?

If yes to all four, you're on brand.
